# Saja Pasal Ecommerce Website With Django + React

Saja Pasal
“Saja” is a public and common places in Nepali language and “Pasal” means
the Shop in Nepali language. As my project is an ecommerce website which
have the foods and juices which you can order online.

Introduction to the Project
Saja Pasal is my small project which deals with the problems of the people who
want to buy the goods in quality and reasonable price. And we are here to help
and save your time of visiting the shop and carrying the house hold stuff from
the shop to the home. And we are here to make sure that people are not buying
the product by paying the high prices. With the Covid19 pandemic, more
consumers are going online to buy everything from groceries to luxury items. In
fact, with an expected global population of 7.87 billion people, that’s about 27.2
percent of the world’s population shopping online.
Likewise Saja pasal is the website where the people can buy the goods at the
rate they are comfortable I design this website for those primary audience which
had made the small shop recently and don’t know the market prices of goods.

Aims and Objectives of the Project
To list out some of the aims of the project, it is listed in point below:
a) Server record all the available stock and their respective price.
b) User select goods with the quantity they needed.
c) The user payment is done from the trustable payment gateway.
d) Then user can finalized their order by adding and canceling.
e) Admin can see the paid details only and unpaid details only.
f) I will also provide the easy way to search the goods
g) Search engine would be easier.
h) Most valuable product will be shown by there rating toward the
products.
i) The program will be easier to understand by the user it will be more
comfortable
j) Choose the product as we give the photo of the goods with its price tag
which help people to confirm the goods.
k) The program design pattern will be flexible.
l) Contact information is given so that people can communicate with us if
there is any problem and misunderstanding.
Project as a Solution
The expected outcomes and deliveries of the project are as described in
the following points:
a) The program will be easier to understand by the user it will be more
comfortable
b) Choose the product as we give the photo of the goods with its price tag
which help people to confirm the goods.
c) there will be bill with the goods and quantity they selected on the right
hand side of the program so that user can estimate the amount is
affordable or not.
d) User can also pay if they are desire to give payment.
e) The customer have to provide the address and there phone no and
pan no of the respective shop and then the name of there shop so
customer can get the vat bill.
f) The program design pattern will be flexible.
g) Contact information is given so that people can communicate with us if
there is any problem and misunderstanding

Choosen methodology
There are many methodologies according to the size, requirements clarity
and other different aspects of the project. Doing analysing on different
methodology and my project requirements, I have chosen incremental model
for my project. Incremental Model is a process of software development
where requirements divided into multiple standalone modules of the software
development cycle. In this model, each module goes through the
requirements, design, implementation and testing phases. Incremental Model
is generally easier to test and debug than other methods of software
development because relatively smaller changes are made during each
iteration and is popular particularly when we have to quickly deliver a limited
functionality system.

Requirement Analysis:
In the first phase of the incremental model, the product analysis expertise
identifies the requirements. And the system functional requirements are
understood by the requirement analysis team. To develop the software under
the incremental model, this phase performs a crucial role.
Design
In this phase of the Incremental model of SDLC, the design of the system
functionality and the development method are finished with success. When
software develops new practicality, the incremental model uses style and
development phase

coding 
This is the third phase. In this phase, coding is done according to the
purpose of the requirements. The coding standards must be followed
without any unnecessary hard codes and defaults. This phase also enables
the implementation of the designs which is done practically. By completing
this phase, the quality of the working product can be upgraded and
enhanced.
Test
In the incremental model, the testing phase checks the performance of each
existing function as well as additional functionality. In the testing phase, the
various methods are used to test the behavior of each task.
I have list out some of the testing that I carried out in this project:
• Validation of the registration of user
• Validation of the login of user
• Successful user registration and login
• Profile update of the user
• Add to cart to product
• Check stock
• Check order
• Khalti Payment
• Show top rated product
• Adding and removing product
• Search Function
• Rating
• User details list
• Order details list
• Feedback
• User Logout 

Learning
From this project I know a lot about the complex of making project and
how the testing is done in project, how to manage the time for the
project and many idea regarding the software engineering. I also know
lot about the new framework for testing the api connectivity and more
advance method to solve the problem in the project.
Problem faces
• Problem while adding the new features
• While connecting api
• While making database
• Not satisfied with any user interface
• Selecting the color
• Making small change on a same function.
Solve the problem
• Asked with the teacher and friend about problems
• Research on the web regarding the problems
• Making erd while making database
• Asked friend for the user interactive interface
• Using color picker and other helpful website.
• Using tester and Django rest framework.
• Documentation of both react and Django .
Experience with the react was quit fun with the complex. React is a great
tool for web development, and as good as it is, it is very easy to learn. 

Learning it at the right time will do you more good. React JS is a good
time to help developers build stunning web apps and user interfaces in
a short time. It allows you to break down components and create onepage applications with minimal coding. Creating the first React app,
we've covered a lot here. One of the biggest takeaways is that the
response is different from other libraries because it uses a whole new
language called JSX to define what the visuals will look like. When we
defined the h1 tag within the render method we found a very small
glimpse of it here. The effect of JSX extends beyond how you define your
UI components. It also changes how you build your application. Because
your browser does not understand JSX in its native representation, you
need to use an intermediate step to convert that JSX to JavaScript. JSX
is an approach to building your application to generate transpired
JavaScript output corresponding to the source. Another approach (aka
we used here) is to use the Babel library to translate JSX into JavaScript
on a browser. While it's not recommended for live / production
applications to hit the action, when you familiarize yourself with the
reaction, you can't beat the convenience. Hooks make the response
better because you have simpler codes that apply the same functionality
faster and more efficiently. You can also implement reaction mode and
lifecycle methods without writing classes. Below are examples of code
to illustrate the reaction class and functional components. Both
Bootstrap and Response are close competitors when it comes to
designing and customizing the best UI for a web application. While
Bootstrap is a template-based frontend framework that provides readymade templates for application development, Feedback is a componentbased framework

Experience from Django was when I was reading the Django official
documentation and the words that were captivating to me were, "Rapid
Application Development" in the Django documentation. I made my first
project of todo app, had to write little code for doing most of the things.
Another boost came when I learned about Django's auto admin panel
and that boost went away when I realized it's really hard to customize

the look and feel of the Django admin. Some people even advised me to
prefer making my own admin panel if you need all sorts of
customizations. I didn't even realize that not everyone asks for
customizations. Most common things like header, site title and the way
you interact with your model in the admin panel, can be modified with
fewer lines of code. Everything is simple, easy to follow but sometimes
you'd have to dig deep down to understand how Django do certain things
and by then you'd have gained enough experience so you won't stress
about it. the project is developed using the proper Software Engineering
process, following the Iterative Model of SDLC. A Project Control List
was created after doing the feasibility study for functionalities as well as
non-functional requirements. Then proper schema and tables that were
supposed to be required in the development process were made and
relationships between each table were drawn. Also, the flow chart was
created so that each process can be done sequentially. After that, each
task from the project control list was coded, tested using White Box
Testing and implemented separately as per the Iterative Model. At last
every unit was integrated and users were selected for Black Box Testing.
Each user was asked to run the project and test each functionality of the
project
